# Add Deployment API to Actions

This will help showcase your deployments to multiple environments

In your Workflow, you can add the following code to connect to the GitHub Deployment API and update your workflows:
```yaml
# Update deployment API
- name: start deployment
  uses: bobheadxi/deployments@v0.4.3
  id: deployment
  with:
    step: start
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    env: Production

# ... additional code that should run during the deployment

# Update Deployment API
- name: update deployment status
  uses: bobheadxi/deployments@v0.4.3
  if: always()
  with:
    step: finish
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    deployment_id: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.deployment_id }}
