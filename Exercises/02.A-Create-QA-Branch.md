# Creating additional protected branches
Many companies follow differnt models of deployment and flow. Some only require the simple Github flow, while others use a more legacy git flow.
If you follow more of the git flow, you will likely need to create additonal protected branches like `DEV`, `QA`, or `PROD`. Once you have set up those branch protections, you can then use them later on to help trigger additional wortkflows and flags.

To protect our new branch and require at least one review and a passing test, perform the following:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
1. In the left menu, click **Branches**.
1. Next to "Branch protection rules", click **Add rule**.
1. Under "Branch name pattern", type `main`.
1. Select the **Require pull request reviews before merging** checkbox.
1. Select the **Require status checks to pass before merging** checkbox.
1. Select the **Continuous Integration** checkbox in the Status checks found in the last week for this repository.
1. Click **Save changes**.
